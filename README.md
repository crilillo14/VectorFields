# VectorFields
Visualization of a vector field using p5js, its purpose solely being deciding whether to develop either an Eulerian field-based fluid simulation or a particle based Lagrangian fluid sim. After careful consideration, because particle-based sims are way cooler visually and Eulerian vector field makes less sense in my head.
